            "Consul," said he, without preamble, "I have strong reasons for
            believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia." And he narrated
            what had just passed concerning the passport. "Well, Mr. Fix," replied
            the consul, "I shall not be sorry to see the rascal's face; but perhaps
            he won't come here&mdash;that is, if he is the person you suppose him
            to be.  A robber doesn't quite like to leave traces of his flight
            behind him; and, besides, he is not obliged to have his passport
            countersigned." "If he is as shrewd as I think he is, consul, he will
            come." "To have his passport visaed?" "Yes.  Passports are only good
            for annoying honest folks, and aiding in the flight of rogues.  I
            assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do; but I hope you
            will not visa the passport." "Why not?  If the passport is genuine I
            have no right to refuse." "Still, I must keep this man here until I
            can get a warrant to arrest him from London." "Ah, that's your
            look-out.  But I cannot&mdash;" The consul did not finish his
            sentence, for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door, and two
            strangers entered, one of whom was the
